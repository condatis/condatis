Condatis; software to assist with the planning of habitat restoration

Condatis is distributed under GPL v3. See Condatis-License.html.

To build and run condatis you will need python 2.7 with the following libraries

Numpy
Scipy
Matplotlib
PyQt4
GDAL
PIL
Pytables

A convenient way of installing this is to use the Anaconda python distribution. All the packages need come as standard with Anaconda except GDAL. This can be installed in Anaconda with the command

$ conda install gdal

The user interface files are distributed in XML format as generated by Qt Designed. A makefile is distribited with Condatis to ease generation of the python files.

Condatis can then be run (from the installation directory) either by

$ ./condatis.py

or

$ python condatis.py

If you are using Anaconda, please make sure that the path is set to run the Anaconda distribution of python.
